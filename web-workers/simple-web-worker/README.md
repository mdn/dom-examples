To use `npx lite-server`, you first need to ensure that you have `lite-server` installed in your project. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install lite-server --save-dev
```

Once `lite-server` is installed, you can start it using the command:

```bash
npx lite-server
```

This command will launch a lightweight development server that serves your application and automatically reloads the page when changes are detected in your files. Make sure you have a `bs-config.json` file or a `package.json` script configured for `lite-server` if you need to customize its behavior.
