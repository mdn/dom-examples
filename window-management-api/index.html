  <h1>Window Management API demo</h1>

  <p>This page provides a basic demo of the <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Management_API">Window Management API</a>, which in
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Management_API#browser_compatibility">supporting
      browsers</a> provides a button to open multiple windows to provide an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript learning
    environment, tailored to whether you have one, two, or more screens available.
  </p>

  <p>On non-supporting browsers it will provide links to the different windows instead, so users of those browsers can
    have access to that content, and can choose to arrange the opened pages in new tabs or windows as they see fit.</p>
