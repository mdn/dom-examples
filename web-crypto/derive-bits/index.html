      <h1>Web Crypto: deriveBits</h1>

      <section class="description">
        <p>This page shows how to use the <code>deriveBits()</code> function of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Crypto API</a>. It contains two separate examples, one for PBKDF2 and one for ECDH.</p>

        <p>It's important to note that although both are defined in the API as key derivation functions, PBKDF2 and ECDH have very different use cases and characteristics.</p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>PBKDF2 example</h2>
        <p>The PBKDF2 algorithm is used here to derive some bits from a password.</p>
        <p>When you click "Derive bits" the example prompts you for a password and then derives some bits from the password using PBKDF2, and a representation of the derived bits is displayed.</p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>ECDH example</h2>
        <p>The ECDH algorithm is more commonly called a "key agreement" algorithm. It enables two parties (conventionally called "Alice" and "Bob"), each of whom has a public/private key pair, to establish a shared secret key.</p>
        <p>With this example we've created two ECDH key pairs, one for Alice and one for Bob.</p>
        <p>When you click "Derive bits" the example uses Alice's private key and Bob's public key to derive a shared secret, and a representation of the shared secret is displayed.</p>
