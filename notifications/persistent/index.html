    <p>This website shows how to make and handle persistent notifications.</p>

    <p>
      It registers a service worker, whose job is to handle notifications. When
      the "Notify me!" button is clicked, the website does the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Checks whether the website has permission to show notifications, asking
        for permission if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>If permission is granted, starts a one-second timer.</li>
      <li>
        When the timer expires, gets the service worker registration, waiting
        for it to become active if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Calls <code>registration.showNotification()</code>, passing in two
        actions.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The notification presents the actions to the user. If the user clicks the
      notification, then the browser starts the service worker, if it is not
      already running, and dispatches the
      <code>notificationclick</code> event. If the user selected an action, then
      the event object includes the selected action.
    </p>

    <p>
      The service worker's <code>notificationclick</code> handler checks the
      value of the event's <code>action</code>, and responds by opening the
      appropriate web page.
    </p>
