      <h2>Responsive narrow-wide function</h2>
      <p>
        This example features a custom CSS function called
        <code>--narrow-wide()</code>, which takes two parameters — a value to
        apply to a narrow layout and a value to apply to a wide layout.

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The custom function is very useful — you can use it as the value of just
        about any property where you want to provide a choice of values — one
        for a narrow layout and one for a wide layout.

      <h2>Defining the function</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>--narrow-wide()</code> function is built using two CSS custom
        properties and a media query to detect whether the viewport is narrower
        or wider than the provided breakpoint, and return one value or the other
        as appropriate.
