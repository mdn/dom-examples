    <h1>Contact Picker API Demo</h1>

    <p id="notSupported">
      <b>Sorry!</b> This browser doesn't support the Contact Picker API, which
      required for this demo. Try using Chrome on Android and try again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Access to the userâ€™s contacts has been a feature of native apps since
      (almost) the dawn of time. The <b>Contact Picker API</b> is a new,
      on-demand picker that allows users to select an entry or entries from
      their contact list and share limited details of the selected contact(s)
      with a website. It allows users to share only what they want, when they
      want, and makes it easier for users to reach and connect with their
      friends and family.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> This demo requires Chrome 80 or later running on Android M or
      later to work properly.
    </p>

      This demo <b>does not</b>
      share or upload your contacts. It simply shows them on screen, and no
      contact data is transferred off this device.
