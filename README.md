This repository is for examples and demos of the [Web Performance APIs](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Web_Performance/Publications).

Examples:

* [Using the Resource Timing API](http://mdn.github.io/web-performance/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API.html) interface. This Web app is described in MDN's [Using the Resource Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API) guide. It shows basic usage of the [Resource Timing](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/) standard's interfaces.
* [Check Browser's Web Performance API support](http://mdn.github.io/web-performance/perf-api-support.html). This app gives the browser's Yes/No support of [Web Performance APIs](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Web_Performance/Publications). Several APIs and specs are covered with more to come (PRs welcomed and encouraged!).
