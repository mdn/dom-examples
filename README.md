This repository is for examples and demos of the [Touch Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events) standard.

Examples:
* [Multi-touch interaction](http://mdn.github.io/touchevents/Multi-touch_interaction.html). This example demonstrates basic multi-touch using touch events, thus it requires the browser to  support the [Touch Events standard](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/). This example is used in [MDN's Multi-touch interaction Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Multi-touch_interaction).
